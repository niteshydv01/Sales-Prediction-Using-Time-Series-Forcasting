<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project focuses on building a sales prediction model for the
Rossmann Store Sales dataset. Predicting sales is critical for
businesses to manage inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies
effectively. The task involved exploring time-series data, applying
feature engineering, and training predictive models using two
different approaches:<br>
        
1. XGBoost Regressor - XGBoost leverages tree-based ensemble
learning for structured data.<br>
2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - A deep learning model
suited for sequential data. LSTM is a neural network designed
to capture temporal dependencies in sequential datasets.
